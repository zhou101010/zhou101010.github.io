Welcome! I am Zexi (周泽茜）
======

​I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Hong Kong. 

My research interests cover Empirical Industrial Organization, Trade, and Urban Economics, focusing on economic geography, production networks, firm dynamics, and place-based industrial policy. 


​I am especially interested in questions broadly related to how production linkages and geographical proximity affect the decisions and performance of heterogeneous firms and how they impact the aggregate economy. In my research, I study how industrial clusters with input-output linkages form and generate impacts on firms, using structural tools from empirical IO and spatial equilibrium models.
