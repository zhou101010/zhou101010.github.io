Welcome! 
======
I am Zexi (周泽茜).

​I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Hong Kong. 

My research interests cover Empirical Industrial Organization, Trade, and Urban Economics, focusing on economic geography, production networks, firm dynamics, and place-based industrial policy. 

​I am especially interested in questions broadly related to how production linkages and geographical proximity affect the decisions and performance of heterogeneous firms and how they impact the aggregate economy. In my research, I study how industrial clusters with input-output linkages form and generate impacts on firms, using structural tools from empirical IO and spatial equilibrium models.

Industrial Clustering with Production Linkages: Micro Evidence and Aggregate Implications in China (with Hongsong Zhang) (draft available upon request)

Presentations: The 18th North American Meeting of the Urban Economics Association (Georgetown University), the 2nd Summer Meeting in Urban Economics China (PKU), the Econometric Society Australia Meeting 2024* (Monash University), the European Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society 2024* (EWMES), CUFE, HUST, JNU

Abstract: Firms with vertical production linkages tend to co-locate and form clusters. To investigate this phenomenon, this paper constructs a novel linkage-based clustering index using firm-level data and the national Input-Output (IO) table in China, and examines its impact on firm performance and regional industrial growth. Our findings reveal that vertical agglomeration arises through multiple channels: firms in upstream clusters benefit from cost advantages due to reduced input prices, while firms in downstream clusters experience higher productivity and markups driven by production externalities and demand enhancement. Additionally, both upstream and downstream clusters promote firm innovation through vertical knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, vertical clusters (characterized by the concentration of firms with cross-industry linkages) significantly attract related new entries, whereas horizontal clusters (characterized by the concentration of firms within the same industry) deter similar firms from entering local markets due to competition effects. Beyond these extensive margins, clustering with input-output linkages accounts for 14% of the variation in local value-added change. Ignoring input-output linkages can substantially underestimate the total gains from clustering and overlook the heterogeneous effects of agglomeration based on different linkages.

Special Economic Zones and Regional Economic Growth with Production Networks (with Hongsong Zhang) 

Presentations: HKU Brownbag Seminar

Abstract: This study provides novel evidence on how Development Zones (DZs) have shaped China's manufacturing geography and regional economic growth. Utilizing comprehensive geo-coded data on new firm registrations and DZ policies with industry-specific targets from 1979 to 2019, we investigate the impact of the Development Zone Targeting Industry Policy on local entrepreneurial activities in the manufacturing sectors through direct and vertical spillover channels. Our staggered difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the program increased the number of new entrants by 5% and their scale by 32%, fostering policy-induced clusters of targeted industries. This direct effect is primarily driven by reduced entry costs due to place-based targeting policies. For non-targeted industries, the DZ policy also enhanced the growth of untreated upstream and downstream entrants associated with the targeted industries, despite not receiving direct tax exemptions, subsidies, or land discounts. The input-output linkages across industries play a non-negligible role in connecting place-based industrial policies to enhanced local economic growth.
